# crop-and-OCR-script
a script using pytesseract and Pillow to auto-crop and OCR multiple files across many folders

I am developing this project for two reasons:
1. Help me learn python/git/more programming
2. Automate cropping and OCR-ing of scanned images of newspapers for my local library (going back six decades!)

Hopefully I can someday build this into something useful for other people. In this infancy stage I think it's only useful to me, but I have ideas!
